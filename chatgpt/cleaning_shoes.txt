1. Remove any loose dirt and dust from the shoes using a soft-bristled brush or a dry cloth.
2. Wet the unsoaked rag with water and wring out the excess water.
3. Apply a small amount of soap to the damp rag and lather it up.
4. Gently rub the soap-lathered rag onto the stained areas of the shoes, using circular motions.
5. Rinse the rag with water and wring out the excess water.
6. Use the damp rag to wipe off the soap from the shoes.
7. Dry the shoes with a clean towel.

Unexpected situations that might happen during the common procedure are:

1. The soap may not be effective in removing tough stains, and additional cleaning methods may be needed.
2. The shoes may be made of delicate material that could be damaged by water or soap, so it is essential to test the cleaning method on a small, inconspicuous area first.
3. The shoes may be too wet after cleaning, and it may take longer than expected for them to dry completely.
4. The soap may leave a residue on the shoes, making them look dull or discolored.
5. The shoes may have a strong odor that is difficult to remove, even after cleaning.
