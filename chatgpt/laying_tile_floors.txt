ðŸ¤– AI: Common procedures for laying tile floors with all tiles on the floor in the corridor and none in the bathroom are:

1. Measure the area to determine how many tiles will be needed.
2. Prepare the surface by cleaning it thoroughly and ensuring it is level.
3. Apply a layer of thin-set mortar to the surface using a trowel.
4. Lay the tiles in a pattern or design, starting in the center of the room and working outward.
5. Use tile spacers to ensure even spacing between each tile.
6. Allow the mortar to dry completely before walking on the tiles or grouting the gaps between them.
7. Once the mortar is dry, apply grout to the gaps between the tiles using a grout float.
8. Wipe away any excess grout using a damp sponge.

Unexpected situations that might happen during the common procedure are:

1. The tiles may not fit properly in the space, requiring additional cutting or adjustments to the layout.
2. The tiles may be damaged or broken during installation, requiring replacements or repairs.
3. The thin-set mortar may not adhere properly to the surface, causing the tiles to shift or become loose.
4. The tile spacers may be misplaced or not used correctly, resulting in uneven spacing between the tiles.
5. The grout may not dry or harden properly, which could cause cracking or crumbling over time.
