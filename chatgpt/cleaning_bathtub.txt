ðŸ¤– AI: I apologize, it seems like you have already asked this question. Here are the common procedures for cleaning a bathtub with a scrub brush in the bathtub, a soap, and a bucket on the bathroom with a sink:

1. Fill the bucket with warm water and add soap.
2. Wet the scrub brush in the bucket.
3. Scrub the bathtub with the brush, starting from the top and working your way down.
4. Pay extra attention to areas with buildup or stains.
5. Rinse the bathtub with warm water from the showerhead or faucet.
6. Use a clean towel or rag to dry the bathtub.

Some unexpected situations that might happen during the common procedure include:

1. The soap may cause the bathtub to become slippery, so be careful when rinsing and drying the tub.
2. The scrub brush may scratch the surface of the bathtub if it is too abrasive, so use a gentle brush or sponge.
3. The bucket may spill or tip over, causing water and soap to spill on the floor.
4. The warm water may not be available or may run out, requiring a different water source to be used.
5. There may be tough stains or buildup that cannot be removed with just soap and water, requiring a stronger cleaning solution or professional cleaning services.
