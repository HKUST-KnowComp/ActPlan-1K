1. Remove any loose debris or crumbs from the stove using a dry cloth or a soft-bristled brush.
2. Wet the unsoaked rag with water and wring out the excess water.
3. Apply a small amount of soap to the damp rag and lather it up.
4. Gently scrub the stove with the soapy rag, focusing on the stained or greasy areas.
5. Rinse the rag with water and wring out the excess water.
6. Use the damp rag to wipe off any remaining soap from the stove.
7. Dry the stove with a clean, unsoaked dishtowel.

Unexpected situations that might happen during the common procedure are:

1. The stove may have tough, baked-on stains that are difficult to remove with soap and water alone.
2. The stove may be made of delicate material that could be damaged by water or soap, so it is essential to test the cleaning method on a small, inconspicuous area first.
3. The stove may have crevices or tight spaces that are hard to reach with a rag, requiring the use of specialized cleaning tools.
4. The soap may leave a residue on the stove, making it look dull or discolored.
5. The stove may have a strong odor that is difficult to remove, even after cleaning.
