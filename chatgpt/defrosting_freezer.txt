ðŸ¤– AI: Common procedures for defrosting a freezer with foods in an electric refrigerator, receptacle and bucket on the floor, scraper, tower, and unsoaked rag on the countertop in the kitchen may include:

1. Unplugging the refrigerator and removing all the food from the freezer compartment.
2. Placing the food in a cooler or insulated bag with ice packs to keep it cold while defrosting.
3. Removing the shelves and drawers from the freezer compartment and placing them in the sink to thaw.
4. Placing a towel or bucket on the floor to catch any water that may leak during defrosting.
5. Using a plastic scraper or spatula to gently remove any ice buildup from the freezer walls and floor.
6. Using a towel or rag to wipe up any excess water or ice that may have accumulated in the freezer.

Unexpected situations that might happen during the common procedure include:

1. Discovering that the freezer has a large amount of ice buildup, which may take longer to defrost than anticipated.
2. Finding that the freezer drain is clogged, which may require additional cleaning or repair work to fix.
3. Realizing that the freezer is not properly sealed, which may be causing the ice buildup and require repair or replacement of the door gasket.
4. Running out of space to store the frozen food during defrosting, which may require a temporary freezer or cooler.
5. Accidentally damaging the freezer walls or shelves while scraping off ice, which may require repair or replacement of the damaged parts.
