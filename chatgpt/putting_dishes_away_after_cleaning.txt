ðŸ¤– AI: Common procedures for putting dishes away after cleaning with plates on the countertop in the kitchen with a cabinet are:

1. Pick up each plate and inspect it for any leftover food or debris.
2. Rinse the plate under running water to remove any remaining food particles.
3. Dry the plate with a clean dish towel or let it air dry.
4. Open the cabinet and place the plate in the appropriate spot, usually with similar dishes or in a designated area for plates.

Unexpected situations that might happen during the common procedure are:

1. The plate may slip out of your hands and break, which could result in broken glass or ceramic on the floor.
2. The cabinet may be full or disorganized, making it difficult to find a spot for the plate or risking the plate falling and breaking.
3. The plate may have a hidden crack or chip that is not visible during inspection, which could cause it to break or shatter later on.
4. The dish towel used to dry the plate may be dirty or wet, which could contaminate the plate and require it to be washed again.
5. The countertop may be wet or slippery, increasing the risk of dropping the plate or causing it to slide off the surface.
